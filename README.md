# tastypl

## Description

tastypl is a [Go](https://golang.org/) program that imports your
[tastyworks](https://tastyworks.com/) transactions and figures out some
statistics to help you track your performance and positions.  The main
motivation behind it was to track the net credit after rolls.

## Demo

On the tastyworks desktop app, go to the History tab, and under "transactions"
pick a start date that is before the creation of your account, then click the
CSV button to export all the transactions to a file.  You need _all_ the
transactions in the CSV file otherwise the numbers won't make sense.

Here is a simple example for a portfolio with an AAPL straddle, a BIDU
position that has received an assignment, and a ROKU position that has
been rolled.

```
$ go run tastypl.go -input demo.csv -printpl -positions

The `-chart` option will generate a graph in `rpl.png` that looks like this:

![Realized P/L over time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gotasty/tastypl/master/sample/rpl.png)

On the chart, "adjusted realized P/L" is the realized P/L net of commissions,
fees, interest paid if any, etc.  Outstanding premium is the amount of premium
sold (if positive, bought if negative) at the price it was opened – the script
does not track the mark of positions over time, only opening/closing prices,
as it does not have access to any historical market data.  Cash on hand should
match what is shown in tastyworks' account balance.
